VRocks was developed as a one-page application that allows you to receive, display and filter data from an external REST API.

The data source was been taken from http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/.
Also I worked out on the adaptive design.

Technologies which have been used for the website :
- React.js
- SCSS
- Skeleton
- Normalize
